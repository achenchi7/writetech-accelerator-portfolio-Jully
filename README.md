# My Technical Writing Portfolio
***

This is my technical writing portfolio developed during the [WriteTech](https://writetechhub.org/) 3-month bootcamp

This portfolio is currently **under development** and will be updated as the learning continues. Stay tuned.

## About Me
***
I am a Cloud/DevOps engineer who is passionate about simplifying cloud concepts while maintining quality,  integrity, and user-centricness of the tool/concept at hand. I, therefore, double up as a Technical writer and educator in training.
