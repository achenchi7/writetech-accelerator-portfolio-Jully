**Understanding Terraform: Run Your First Script**

In this project, I documented how to use Terraform to deploy a simple resource â€” a local file â€” as an introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The goal is to provide a hands-on approach for beginners to learn Terraform's basic workflow.

## ðŸŒ± What I Learned

* **How to break down technical concepts for beginners:** Writing this guide helped me distill Terraformâ€™s concepts into manageable chunks for newcomers.
* **Structuring clear, usable technical documentation:** The importance of clear headings, concise descriptions, and actionable steps became evident.
* **The value of trying out what you're documenting:** I found that working through the actual steps of deploying Terraform resources helped me document them more effectively and understand the tool in greater depth.
