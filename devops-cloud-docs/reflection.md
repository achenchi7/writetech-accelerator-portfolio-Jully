# Reflection

Documenting this exercise taught me more than just how to use Terraform — it helped me understand the developer’s journey when approaching a new tool.

Key takeaways:
- **Simplicity matters:** Starting with the `local_file` resource gave me a quick win and boosted confidence.  
- **Documentation style:** Breaking the content into clear sections (overview, setup, usage, troubleshooting) makes learning structured and approachable.  
- **Deeper appreciation for Terraform:** Even a small example showed how Terraform’s workflow (`init`, `plan`, `apply`) provides a predictable pattern for larger infrastructure.  

If I were to improve this further, I’d add visuals or diagrams for the workflow and experiment with real cloud resources. For now, I’ve built a solid foundation and captured the learning process in a way that others can follow easily.
