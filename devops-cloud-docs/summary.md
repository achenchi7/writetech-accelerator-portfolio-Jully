# Summary

In this guide, we explored the basics of Terraform by running a simple script using the `local_file` resource.

Here’s what we covered:
- **Overview:** What Terraform is and why it’s useful for infrastructure as code.  
- **Setup:** How to install and configure Terraform.  
- **Step-by-step:** Writing and applying a `local_file` resource that creates a text file.  
- **Troubleshooting:** Common errors and their solutions.

### What’s next?
Now that you understand the workflow (`init`, `plan`, `apply`, `destroy`) using a local resource, you can try:
- Deploying cloud resources (e.g., AWS S3 bucket, EC2 instance).  
- Exploring variables and outputs for reusable scripts.  
- Learning about Terraform state management and remote backends.
