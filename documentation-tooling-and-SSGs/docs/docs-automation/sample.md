# An h1 header

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

- this one
- that one
- the other one

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.

## An h2 header

Here's a numbered list:

1. first item
2. second item
3. third item

Here’s a code sample:

```bash
# Let me re-iterate ...
for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }
