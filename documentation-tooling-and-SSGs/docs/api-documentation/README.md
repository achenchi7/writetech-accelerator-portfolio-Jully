# API Documentation Project

This project documents the **Payment Request API** public REST API, including a Getting Started section and selected endpoints.

## What I Improved
- Added clear **step-by-step Getting Started instructions** so beginners can set up and make their first request easily.  
- Expanded endpoint documentation to include **parameters tables, request/response examples, and common error notes**.  
- Created a **partial OpenAPI 3.0 specification** for reference, stored in the `reference/` folder.  

## Challenges
- Understanding the **required request headers and parameters** from the official specification, as they were not always clearly documented.  
- Structuring explanations so that they are **useful to both technical and semi-technical readers** without overwhelming them.  

## What I Learnt
- How to write **clear, user-friendly API documentation** that goes beyond just listing endpoints.  
- The importance of including **examples, edge cases, and error handling notes** so developers avoid common pitfalls.  
- Explaining technical terms in plain language (e.g., headers = envelope, API key = password).  
- Adding **step-by-step breakdowns** of requests so beginners can follow along.  
- Highlighting **common mistakes** (like forgetting headers or using the wrong format).
